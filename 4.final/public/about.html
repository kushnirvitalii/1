          Hello! I'm a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and
          functional websites. I have a diverse skill set that includes HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks. Over the past few years, I
          have worked on numerous projects ranging from simple static websites
          to complex web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from XYZ University,
          where I honed my skills in programming and problem-solving. My
          experience includes working as a front-end developer at ABC Company,
          where I contributed to several high-profile projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in
          hackathons, and contributing to open-source projects. I am always
          eager to learn and take on new challenges.
